# Welcome to *Trugle Calendar: Meets Commune*
## The oldstate branch is the new default branch

## The inspiration for the application was an app to make it easier to make new friends and find things to do

## The list of technologies used to build the application are as follows: Supabase(postgresql), Javascript React, Node.js, Express, Tailwind, Fullcalender API, and Vercel.

## How to use the application: 
### Click the start button and then choose between the create event page or the calendar, at this time you may also signup/login if you choose. When in the create event page you can choose to go back to the choose screen or create an event. After the event is created you should be redirected to the calendar where you can see the event you just created. When in the calendar whether or not you've created an event, you can read the calendar and click any events that catch your eye, this will bring you to the event's page where you can read the details of the event.
